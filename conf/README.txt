In this USB drive you can find the configuration files obtained by PETsys during the validation testing of your boards. As mentioned in the software manual, we advise to remake these files on your own as a way to get acquainted with some of the operational specifications of the system.

We also provide a calibration file for the HV DACs of your Power Adapter Board. This calibration was obtained in the 66 - 70 V range.

For any questions or help, just send an e-mail to support@petsyselectronics.com
